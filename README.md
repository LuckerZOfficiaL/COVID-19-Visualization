# COVID-19-Visualization

This is a project done on my own initiative during the COVID-19 Pandemic period. 
The motivation behind it was to create something informative with a social contribution.
The data source gets updated every day and can be found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv
